# JoyDivision-Wave-Animation

This is an audio visualization project inspired by the album cover for Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division and [this](https://intothecontinuum.tumblr.com/post/27443100682/in-july-1967-astronomers-at-the-cavendish) archery post. I recreated the plot from the archery post using matplotlib and applied the visualization for audio data. The `main.py` file will take audio input and create a visualization from the spectrogram.
